## Welcome to my humble abode!

Hi, I'm Arvin Kushwaha! I'm a sophomore at North Carolina State University
working towards a double major in Computer Science and Physics.

This here, as you may already know, is my website! I use this space to talk
about some fun stuff I'm working on and learning about. Feel free to explore!

I highly recommend checking out my [blog](/blog.html) (see menu bar) if you want to learn
a bunch of new, possibly-interesting information or my projects (again, see menu bar)
if you want to see what I've been working on!
